"What is React?
1. React is a JavaScript library/framework for building user interfaces. It was created by META.
2. Websites/UIs are looked at in terms of components.
3. React is currently the most popular out of the major front-end frameworks.
4. It's a UI library. It operates like one and is in direct competition with popular frameworks, but it's a library.
Why React?
1. React allows us to build very dynamic and interactive websites and user interfaces.
2. Very fast, especially with the new compiler.
3. There is a huge ecosystem from Next.js to React Native.
4. Best framework to learn to get a job.
5. React uses a virtual document object model, which is a lightweight copy of the actual dom. When a state is changed, it will update the actual dom after making a comparison between the two.
6. Current version is 18
7. It's extremely popular.
Components
1. Components are the core concept of a any front-end framework.
2. Reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements on the page.
3. Allows us to break down complex UIs, which makes them easier to maintain and scale.
4. Components can get props passed in and can hold their own state.
State
1. State represents the data that a component manages internally
2. This could be form input data, fetched data, UI-related data like if a modal is open/close
3. There is also global state, which relates to the app as a whole and not a single component.
4. the useState hook contains two values, the current state and a function that can be called to update that state.
Hooks
1. Allow us to use state and other React features within functional components
2. useState
3. useEffect
4. useRef
5. useReducer
JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
1. An HTML-like syntax within JavaScript components
2. can't use class, so use className
SPA, SSR & SSG
1. Single Page App - Load a single HTML file and JavaScript loads the entire UI including routes
2. Server-Side Rendered - Server sends fully rendered page to client. You can fetch data and load it as well.
3. Static Site Generation - React generates static HTML files at build time. These are very fast.
Vite
1. Vite is used instead of create-react-app
2. Vite is a super fast front-end ttoolkit that can be used for all kinds of JS projects including React
3. It is built on top of ESBuild, which is a very fast JS bundler.
4. Fast development server with hot-reload.
5. Installed with npm createvite@latest
